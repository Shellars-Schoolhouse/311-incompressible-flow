# 311-incompressible-flow


All programs uploaded are purely for schoolwork purposes. All code was done in MATLAB. All the programs are live scripts so don't worry about running into licescing problems.  


**Notes:**

* *AERE311_Tablecalc* is a general purpose calculator for normal shock, but I would recommend using this [VT calculator](http://www.dept.aoe.vt.edu/~devenpor/aoe3114/calc.html)
* The other scripts starting with *AERE311* are for specific homework problems and probably aren't worth your time
